3. a. The NER results are lower than the POS result by 10-17% (comparing with the precision-scores).
      First reason might be that the NER data has significantly less tags,
       so the same tag may relate to more than one thing.
      Second reason might be that the features we use to predict the tag of each word
       are not helping for the prediction, and relate more to the POS data.
   b. The span-based F scores are lower than the accuracy scores because

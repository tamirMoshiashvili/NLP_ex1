1. create zip for submit of all files
2. DONE
3. create and write the 'writeup.pdf' file

       For the NER dataset, report token accuracy accuracy, as well as span precision, recall and F1.
    4. Is there a difference in behavior between the hmm and maxent taggers? discuss.
    5. Is there a difference in behavior between the datasets? discuss.
    6. What will you change in the hmm tagger to improve accuracy on the named entities data?
    7. What will you change in the memm tagger to improve accuracy on the named entities data,
       on top of what you already did?
    8. Why are span scores lower than accuracy scores?
4. DONE
5. create 'ner.txt' file: (created 'dev_pred_results.txt' which contain the accuracies,
                           I am waiting for Yoav's answer in the piazza)
   1. per-toke accuracy of all taggers on the dev-set
   2. per-span precision, recall and F-measure on the dev-set
   3. brief discussion on the Why's:
      1. The NER results are lower than the POS results (how much lower?), look at the data and think why
      2. The span-based F scores are lower than the accuracy scores. Why?
   4. brief description about the ways we will use to improve the MEMM-taggers on the NER data
6.DONE
7. create directory which will contain info about us (names and IDs)
8. in the memm1 part:
   1. feature_map
   2. upload the model_file to the drive and provide a link to it so the tester can download the model
   3. create features_file_partial
   4. create feature_vecs_partial
